            <p>Inclusion means having an open mind set and giving opportunities to 
                everyone in the community to have an equal chance of living, rights, 
                roles, and getting rid of discrimination on race, disability, gender, 
                medical or any other special needs.</p>

            <h2>Social/Society</h2>
            <p>An inclusive society is a society that over-rides differences of race, 
                gender, class, generation, and geography, and ensures inclusion, equality 
                of opportunity as well as capability of all members of the society to 
                determine an agreed set of social institutions that govern social 
                interaction. (Expert Group Meeting on Promoting Social Integration, 
                Helsinki, July 2008)
