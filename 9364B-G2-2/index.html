            <h3>What does it mean? </h3>
            <p>Inclusion means having an open mind set and giving opportunities to everyone in the community to have an equal chance of living, rights, roles, and getting rid of discrimination on race, disability, gender, medical or any other special needs</p>

        <div class="box"> <img src="pictures/img3.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Education</h3>

            <h3>Social/Society</h3>
            <p>An inclusive society is a society that over-rides differences of race, gender, class, generation, and geography, and ensures inclusion, equality of opportunity as well as capability of all members of the society to determine an agreed set of social institutions that govern social interaction. (Expert Group Meeting on Promoting Social Integration, Helsinki, July 2008)</p>

            <p>A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.[1] In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, administration, and judiciary.
